.jcgAPPENDIX Device Specifications
This Appendix describes the characteristics and capabilities of those devices supported by DIMFILM.  As additional devices are made available in DIMFILM their descriptions will be added here.  The previous Appendix should be consulted for comparison of various device categories in so far as their mode of operation affects the appearance of graphical output.
.jcgSECTION DICOMED Colour Film Recorder D(1)48C
The Dicomed D48C graphic COM system is a high precision colour film recorder.  In D148C configuration it includes a Digital Equipment Corporation controlling mini-computer.  The name D48C refers to the graphic recorder, comprising firmware controller, precision CRT, film transports and optical assemblies.
The D48C is capable of image recording in vector, raster and alphanumeric modes, and may be used for either colour or monochrome recording dependent on film/optics used.  It is ideally suited to many applications, including scientific plotting, business graphics (vector or raster), animation, engineering and design, and alphanumeric COM (Computer Output Microform, e.g.  microfiche output - which may incorporate other graphics).
As a film recorder the Dicomed D48C captures the image of a variable intensity spot as it traverses a precision cathode ray tube.  This CRT uses the P48 phosphor (wide spectral response), and colour is achieved by insertion of coloured filters in the optical path.  For each colour filter the corresponding components of the image are traced - that is, recording is in an additive manner (filters being used singly, not in combination).  The filter assembly comprises seven colours (red, green, blue, yellow, magenta, cyan, and neutral) and is used in conjunction with specially designed colour corrected optics.  (Note: colour output at ULCC is currently produced by accessing the red, green, and blue filters alone and streaming the plot data accordingly.) For use with black and white film the neutral filter may be utilised; however, for the highest resolution in black and white on the aperture format a separate narrow spectral response lens is used (without filter assembly).  Three optical assemblies are in use at ULCC for graphic COM: F300 for 16mm cine (colour and black and white), F304 for 35mm slide (i.e.  comic - colour), and F309 for 35mm aperture card format (black and white).
The film transport (F333A - manufactured by Marron Carrell), which sits atop the optical assemblies, is able to handle 16mm (perforated) and 35mm (both perforated and unperforated) with 400 feet film magazines.  This is accomplished through changes to the transport mechanics and use of appropriate aperture plates.
In vector mode , the D48C has an addressability of 32,768 x 32,768 upon the CRT (the optics/film format will result in a [maximised] subset of this being available for each film format).  The D48C is capable of very fast vector plotting: a minimum length vector (single point) will take 15 microseconds, while a full-screen, maximum intensity vector can be drawn in 45 milliseconds (single pass).  The time required is roughly proportional to the vector length.  Exposure may be at any of 256 levels (for any one filter).  In drawing a vector, the D48C deflection system is used to accurately position the beam at selected points on the 32K x 32K matrix when the exposure logic turns the beam on for the requisite time.  The points are selected so that the vector is drawn as a continuous and uniform intensity line (through ensuring adjacent points touch).
In raster mode , the D48C is able to plot on a matrix of 4096 x 4096 addressable points (pixels - i.e.  picture elements) on the CRT (again, a subset is available to each film format) at any of 256 exposure values.  The difference between vector and raster addressability is due to the spot size generated; the raster spacing ensures a continuous image through the touching of adjacent points.  The Dicomed provides the user with the means to construct display pixels as composite points with control over point and element spacing.  This enables other raster "resolutions" to be imaged.  Point plotting in raster mode may be accomplished at speeds of 100K-250K points per second, enabling maximum resolution raster images in full colour (three passes) to be plotted in around 3 minutes.  The maximum flyback time for repositioning the beam to the next scan line is 100 microseconds; for certain applications a short end of line delay of (about) 15 microseconds may be introduced.
In point mode , the D48C may be positioned to any of the CRT's 32,768 x 32,768 addressable points, which may then be exposed at any of 256 levels.  The maximum time to position to any point is 100 microseconds, while exposure may be from (about) 4 to 9 microseconds.
In character mode , the D48C has a high speed hardware character generator.  This is particularly relevant to alphanumeric COM applications.  The character fonts are stored in local memory, and depending on complexity a number of fonts may be accommodated simultaneously, with less than 50 milliseconds required for font changes.  Characters may be generated at different sizes and in four orientations, as standard.  Speed depends on font complexity, but for typical alphanumeric COM applications speeds in excess of 30,000 characters per second may be achieved.  (In practice, throughput is dependant on input rates to the D48C.) The hardware character generator functions at only one exposure level and differs from other drawing modes through operating as a stroke generator.  Each character is drawn at high-speed as a series of short vectors and the CRT beam is unblanked throughout the duration of each stroke.
Intensity/exposure control is over an 8-bit (i.e.  256 level) range.  However, this range is selected according to the plot mode in use: vector, raster, point, and character modes all access different CRT intensity scales in order to achieve compatible film exposure when modes are intermixed on a frame.  [It should be noted that hardware characters may only be generated at a single exposure level.] The D48C incorporates further internal exposure tables that are selectable according to the optics and emulsion characteristics to ensure consistent film exposure under the different operating conditions.  Separate table references are made according to the selected filter.  These tables are programmable so that alternative emulsions may be used and the system calibrated accordingly.  Indeed, calibration is required for each film type and for each optical assembly with which it may be used: this calibration is for each plotting mode and (for colour assemblies) each filter.  In vector mode the internal intensity value is dynamically compensated according to the angle at which a vector is drawn.  The exposure technique is time modulation which controls the density of individual points directly through the duration for which the CRT is excited.  This ensures precise control and a high degree of repeatability with consistent line width.
The$ bgeometrics of the D48C offer a very high precision with minimal distortion and a high degree of repeatability.  With regard to the major axis, trapezoiding , rectangularity , linearity , and line curvature (or pin cushion distortion ) are all maintained to less than (plus or minus) 0.1%, while orthogonality of the horizontal and vertical axes is within (plus or minus) 0.15%.  The spatial repeatability is within (plus or minus) 0.02% over a ten-minute interval, and (plus or minus) 0.05% over a thirty-minute interval (after a one-hour warm up).
The photometrics of the D48C offers a dynamic exposure range of 256 levels.  In terms of diffuse density units (D), the range on a typical panchromatic film (e.g.  Kodak Plus-X) will be 1.5D when processed to gamma 1.0 (or 2.0D for gamma 1.5).  The exposure uniformity over the entire plotting area has a maximum deviation of (plus or minus) 0.15D (measured through a circular aperture of 3 millimetres diameter).
The film resolution is a function of optics and film type.  Measurements are in line pairs per millimetre and are referenced to black and white film.  For the optics in use at ULCC the target resolutions are:
.jcgDISPLAY

    Optics          resolution
                         (lpm)
    F300 (16mm)           90
    F304 (35mm slide)     40
    F309 (35mm aperture)  55


.jcgENDD
[It is important to appreciate that these are the resolutions that may be achieved at the film plane on high resolution film, such as DACO E.  It is possible to resolve 3000 lines across the image area on the CRT of the D48C.  The 4K raster of the D48C is designed so adjacent lines merge and a continuous image is perceived.]
Registration accuracy on the F333A film transport is maintained within (plus or minus) 0.005 millimetres.  This is of significance in generation of cinematographic film and is adequate for producing steady images.
In practice, measurements on the D48C at ULCC (for geometrics, photometrics resolution and registration) have consistently indicated performance well within these limits.
There are a number of aspects concerning use of the D48C that are generally applicable to all devices.  These are dealt with in the following sections, after which each film mode is considered separately (i.e.  these being the different devices supported on the Dicomed).
.jcgSUBSECTION Prime
An image is recorded from the excitation of phosphor on the CRT (through a controlled exposure of an electron beam).  After the excitation - and associated luminescence - of the phosphor it must stabilise at a neutral level.  If this stabilisation is not allowed to occur the next phosphor excitation may result in greater luminescence.  That is, the exposure on the film may be greater than that desired.  This effect may be observed as the "ghosting" of earlier images superimposed upon the current picture, and is known as image retention .  It occurs most commonly on raster images (particularly in those areas of relatively low intensity) and is more usually noticed on grey scale images (on black and white film).  The retained image is often a previously drawn vector picture or components from several.  Usually lines drawn at high intensity will be subject to retention, although repeated tracing across the same area of the CRT [i.e.  identically positioned vectors, which might be user data or the ULCC identification frame(s)] may also be retained.
Consider the case of a high intensity vector (redrawn several times) followed by a low intensity uniform raster.  Each point in the raster image will be subject to the same length of electron beam excitation on the CRT, and it would be expected that even exposure of the film across the raster would result.  However, those areas of the CRT on which the vector was drawn may not have relaxed to the appropriate neutral level.  At those points although excited for the same length of time phosphor luminescence will be at a different level than elsewhere: the result is a uniform raster with a vector superimposed.  The effects on vector images are virtually unnoticeable.  This is due partly to the very small overlap of vectors which might exhibit retention (intersections of line width slightly enhanced would not be perceived), but mainly to the fact that vectors are produced via higher exposures than rasters (dictated by relative visual perception) and so retention effects are proportionately lower.  Similarly, with colour rasters exposures are at a higher level than for black and white due to film characteristics and spectral filtering (i.e.  the filter cuts the transmission of phosphor luminescence considerably; conversely a longer exposure is required for a similar effect on film).  Again, the effect may be observed on low intensity colour rasters.  Similarly, high intensity raster images occasionly result in noticeable image retention on subsequent lower intensity rasters.  The effect is not confined to adjacent images and may become apparent some considerable time later.  Image retention is dependent on phosphor characteristics (in the case of the D48C this is P48).  At ULCC the Dicomed is periodically primed ; that is, the CRT is saturated with a uniform high intensity raster.  This reduces image retention to a very high degree.  However, image retention may become a problem during graphic generation from stacked data (the method by which ULCC combine the plot data of many individual users into a single, continuous input to the Dicomed).  To help obviate this DIMFILM users are provided with a means to prime the CRT during their plot run.

.jcgTT

	DPRIME(<device>)
 
	- this will cause the CRT to be primed for the designated device, provided it is currently active.  If the display surface is non-empty it will be cleared before the prime is initiated.  The frame will always be advanced after the prime.  The single parameter is of type CHARACTER and should be a string comprising the device designation:
 
	 'D35'	- will prime device D35 (35mm black and white aperture card format)
 
	 'D35P'	- will prime device D35P (35mm black and white portrait mode format)
 
	 'D16'	- will prime device D16 (16mm black and white movie)
 
	 'D35C'	- will prime device D35C (35mm colour slide)
 
	 'D16C'	- will prime device D16C (16mm colour movie)
 
	 'ALL'	- will prime all active Dicomed devices

.jcgEE

Specific references exist for each individual device if such mode is preferred (these being detailed under the section for relating to each device).
It should be noted that priming will expose a frame of film (the film transport having no shutter).  Thus, priming is inappropriate to cinematographic output except preceding sequences.
Most users will not find image retention a problem.  The facility is included for users who encounter such effects.  Priming is a relatively slow process and excessive use could degrade throughput of the Dicomed system.  The length of this section is not intended to emphasise the problem, but to explain and reassure users when it is first encountered.

.jcgSUBSECTION Frame repetition
In certain applications it is useful to repeat (either singly or multiply) the generation of each successive frame.  In particular, for animations which require twnety-four images for every second of screen time (twenty-five if destined for PAL video) great economies of computation may be made by "double framing", i.e.  repeating each image.  Thus for every second only twelve images will have been computed.  Much animation can be successfully created in this way with little, or no, jitter or judder apparent to the viewer.
Most animations will require action to be held for periods of time; it is then sensible to instruct the system to replicate a particular frame the relevant number of times (avoiding repeatedly re-computing the same image).
Two device specific routines are provided in DIMFILM for these purposes.

.jcgTT

	DMULTI(<device>,MFRAM)
 
	- this will set the multi-frame count for the specified device (or, optionally, for all active Dicvomed devices).
  
	  <device>	- is of type CHARACTER, and should be a string containing the device designation (i.e.  any of 'D35', 'D35P', 'D16', 'D35C',or 'D16C' for a specific device or 'ALL' for all active Dicomed devices).
  
	  MFRAM	- is the required multi-frame count (in range [0,5]) for all subnsequent frames.


.jcgEE

It must be noted that DMULTI is a deferred action: it does not take effect until after the next frame advance is executed.  Subsequent to that advance, following frames will be replicated to generate the specified number of copies of each.
In particular, double framing will be achieved by setting MFRAM = 2.  While for MFRAM = N a total of N frames will be generated for each following image.  MFRAM = 1 is single framing, and is equivalent to MFRAM = 0.  In each case the action will commence following the next reference to FRAME (it is, therefore, sensible - as an aid to clarity - to position the refernce to DMULTI to immediately precede a frame advanmce (i.e.  reference to FRAME): the image following that advance will then be the one for which the DMULTI action first takes effect.  It will remain active until reset.
(Single and double framing may also be achieved through reference to the DSET routine, described below.)

.jcgTT

	DHOLD(<device>,NFRAMS)
 
	- this will repeat the next frame the specified number of times, for the designated 16mm device, provided it is currently active.
  
	  <device>	- is of type CHARACTER, and should be a string containing the device designation (i.e.  any either 'D16', or 'D16C').  This option is only available for 16mm animations on the Dicomed film rcorder.
  
	  NFRAMS	- is the numbers of times the following complete frame is to be generated.


.jcgEE

It must be noted that DHOLD is available only for 16mm film devices.  The action is deferred until the next frame advance is executed.  The following frame will then be generated the requisite number of times, after which framing will revert to single or multi framing (as presently set).  In particular, NFRAMS is the number of frames in total that will be generated for the hold.  That is, if NFRAMS = 1 a single frame only will be produced (even if currently multi-framing).  In general, for NFRAMS = N the original frame will be generated followed by (N-1) repeats, yielding a total of N frames.  As DHOLD is a deferred action it is sensible to position the reference to it to immediately precede a frame advance (i.e.  reference to FRAME): the image following that advance will then be the one to which the DHOLD action refers.

.jcgSUBSECTION Dicomed device control
There are other ways in which Dicomed devices can be controlled or reset.  A routine, DSET, has been provided for some such requirements.  In particular, this can be used to globally change the orientation of a device or to control single or double framing (in this it is a simple alternative to the facility provided in the DMULTI routine).

.jcgTT

	DSET(<device>,KEY)
 
	- this will select particular operational modes for the specified device (or, optionally, for all active Dicvomed devices).
  
	  <device>	- is of type CHARACTER, and should be a string containing the device designation (i.e.  any of 'D35', 'D35P', 'D16', 'D35C',or 'D16C' for a specific device or 'ALL' for all active Dicomed devices).
  
	  KEY	- is a character string specifying the required action.  It may be one of the following:
 
	 SINGLE	- turn on single framing, deferred until after the next frame advance.
  
	  DOUBLE	- turn on double framing, deferred until after the next frame advance.
  
	  COMIC	- turn on comic mode orientation.
  
	  CINE	- turn on cine mode orientation.
  
	  LANDSCAPE	- turn on landscape mode orientation.
  
	  PORTRAIT	- turn on portrait mode orientation.


.jcgEE

For a fuller discussion of single and multi framing refer to the description of DMULTI.
Orientation of an image may be considered in two ways.  Typically one refers to a picture as being in either landscape or portrait orientation.  A picture is said to be landscape if its longer dimnension is horizontal, while it is portrait if its longer dimension runs vertically.
For film the equivalent term is comic or cine; for comic mode the picture base is longitudinal with respect to the (edge of the) film, while in cine mode the base of the image is transverse (i.e.  across the film).  For each film format there is a different default and imaging is done relative to this.  Through reference to DSET it is possible to change that orientation.  The effect is of rotating the image through ninety degrees before recording it on the film.  The default mode for 16mm film is CINE and for 35mm is COMIC, but due to the aspect ratios of each both correspond to LANDSCAPE images.  (For 16mm the longer dimension is transverse, while for 35mm it is longitudinal.) Thus the default image layout is LANDSCAPE for all the Dicomed film modes.  The routine DSET enables the production of, for example, portrait mode slides or portrait mode images on 16mm (the latter would be unsuited for projection, but would be quite suitable for archive purposes).

.jcgDISPLAY

 For each device the equivalent combinations may be shown as:


 DEVICE:       D35      D16     D35P     D35C    D16C

 ASPECT
 RATIO

 LANDSCAPE    COMIC    CINE    COMIC    COMIC    CINE <--DEFAULT

 PORTRAIT     CINE     COMIC   CINE     CINE     COMIC


.jcgENDD


It is strongly advised that changes of orientation are made only at the beginning of a frame; they take immediate effect and various device transformations will be reset to reflect the selected mode.

.jcgSUBSECTION Raster elements
As intimated above, the raster element as used on the D48C may be composed of a grouping of points with both point and element spacing being variable.  DIMFILM raster facilities do not require the user to address this topic.  All mappings from the cell mapped area to device raster elements are performed within the device drivers.  However, it is recognised that for certain serious applications the user will require more detailed understanding of the raster construction.  Additionally the user is provided with the means to respecify the raster characteristics (and DIMFILM will take account of the actual raster structure when transmitting cell data to the Dicomed).
The Raster element is the unit by which the D48C plots a raster picture (i.e.  it is the basic picture element, or pixel ).  When a raster is transmitted to the D48C a series of required pixel intensity values are transferred.  Successive raster elements are plotted with those successive intensities, the same intensity being applied to each point in the element.  When one element has been plotted the beam is spaced to the next; when a scan line is complete the beam is repositioned ready for the next scan.  The element spacing (both horizontally and vertically) may be set.  Each raster element is a square or rectangular array of one to sixteen points in each of the horizontal and vertical directions.  The point spacing (both horizontally and vertically) within the element may also be set.  The points correspond to the 32K grid addressability which may be used to expose a single spot on the CRT - these points should not be confused with pixels, of which they are a component.  Only in the limiting case of elements consisting of single points will points be equivalent to pixels.  The raster elements are the pixels of which the image is composed, and it will be seen that the D48C offers the user the ability to specify both the size and spacing of pixels.
The raster structure is determined by a number of parameters.  The raster element consists of an array of points, arranged with a specified number of points horizontally and a number of points vertically , these being in the range [1,16].  Spacings are expressed in raster units.  That is, in terms of the 4K x 4K maximum raster grid of the D48C.  However, the spacings may be stepped by eighths of the raster unit which is equivalent to units on the 32K x 32K addressable grid of the CRT.  (It is these latter units which are used in DIMFILM.) The spacing of points within this array may be set independently in each direction via the horizontal point spacing and the vertical point spacing , each of these being in the range 1 to 7-7/8 raster units (i.e.  in the range [8,63] CRT addressable units).  Similarly, elements may be spaced in each direction by specifying the horizontal element spacing and the vertical element spacing , again in the range 1 to 7-7/8 raster units (i.e.  [8,63] CRT addressable units).  The element spacing is measured between the lower left corners of adjacent elements (in the appropriate direction), and should be such that adjacent elements do not overlap (i.e.  in either direction the element spacing should exceed the product of the number of points and the point spacing).

In the foregoing illustration, the lines represent a part of a 4K x 4K grid on the CRT (i.e.  raster units).  The 'O's are the points comprising one raster element, while the 'X's are points in adjacent elements.  The grid divisions (i.e.  1/4096 of image dimension) are termed raster units .  In the example a raster element consists of six points arranged as 2 horizontally by 3 vertically.  The horizontal point spacing is 1 raster unit, and the vertical point spacing is 1.5 raster units.  The spacing between elements is determined by the horizontal element spacing of 3 raster units, and a vertical element spacing of 7 raster units.
DIMFILM provides the means whereby the user may change the specification of the raster structure.

	- this will set the raster structure for the designated device, provided it is currently active.
  
	  <device>	- is of type CHARACTER, and should be a string containing the device designation (i.e.  any of 'D35', 'D35P', 'D16', 'D35C', 'D16C' for a specific device or 'ALL' for all active Dicomed devices),
 
	 HES	- is the horizontal element spacing in CRT addressable units (= 8 x raster unit ), as an INTEGER in the range [8,63], but subject to exceeding HPExHPS.
  
	  HPS	- is the horizontal point spacing in CRT addressable units (= 8 x raster unit ), as an INTEGER in the range [8,63].

Specific references exist for each individual device if such mode is preferred.
On initialisation, each Dicomed device is initialised with a 2048 x 2048 raster with elements consisting of 2 x 2 unit spaced points.  Element spacing is 2 raster units.  The equivalent parameters to DRAST would be HES = 16, HPS = 8, HPE = 2, VES = 16, VPS = 8, and VPE = 2.  For most purposes this will yield eminently acceptable results.
.jcgSUBSECTION Line Width/Spot Size
The Dicomed devices are able to produce thickened lines and (hardware) spots of various sizes.  These are controlled through the DIMFILM routines for line width and spot size scale factors.  The supported range is from 1 to 16 in each case - the default being for a single width line and minimal point.  Scale factors below 1.0 will equate to the (default) of 1.0, while values above 1.0 will select the nearest integral value up to a maximum of 16.
NOTE : At present multi-width lines on the Dicomed are produced on a vector by vector basis and no account is made of any preceding or following vector.  Unacceptable results will be produced for thick lines forming parts of curves (in particular characters).  This will be investigated in due course; until it has been resolved users are advised to restrict their use of thickened lines to lower values of the scale factor (a maximum of 3.0 is suggested).
.jcgSUBSECTION Plot Dataset Length
DIMFILM attempts to utilise the Amdahl queues in an economic and efficient manner.  To this end a limit is applied to the permitted size of a user's plot dataset.  At present, the Dicomed drivers will terminate when a dataset length of 100 MBytes is exceeded.  We shall review this limit in the light of experience, and would be pleased to hear from users who encounter difficulties as a result of this limit.  It is possible that the limit may be reduced if operational difficulties result - every effort will be made to give notice of such change, but this cannot be guaranteed.
.jcgSUBSECTION Device Sizes
The physical image size on film for each of the Dicomed modes is maintained, to a close tolerance, according to various international standards.  The default coordinate system for each film device is intended to produce images of the defined size (within the physical device limitations).  While these have been carefully determined, the right is reserved to amend them should the need arise.  There will be no effect upon users specifying their own coordinate system through reference to BOUNDS.
