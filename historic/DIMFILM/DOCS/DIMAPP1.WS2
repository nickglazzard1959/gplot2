.jcgAPPENDIX Using DIMFILM at ULCC
DIMFILM is currently available on both the Amdahl 5890 and the Cray X-MP at ULCC.  It is intended that the user interface as described in this document will not be subject to change.  Please advise Graphics Development Group at ULCC of any problems with this product.  We shall endeavour to fix reported bugs at the earliest possible moment.  Similarly new features will be incorporated as they become available and will be documented by revisions to this guide.
It should be noted that some microfilm services (notably, colour film) may be subject to a charge.  In these cases users must ensure that their intended usage is covered by an official college order.  This should be directed to the Microform Section of the Operations Division (not Allocation and Control or Administration).  The order may cover a single account number, a department or whole institution, and may indicate either a monetary limit or expiry date.  Any enquiries regarding this should be directed to Claire Steward (extension 365).
.jcgSECTION Amdahl 5890 - VM/CMS Service
The DIMFILM library is produced under VS FORTRAN Version 2, a Fortran 77 compiler available under VM/CMS.  DIMFILM is built with the latest version of this compiler.
Under CMS the implementation of DIMFILM and its internal interface to the Dicomed film recorder makes use of virtual device addresses - these may be in the range 180-183 (inclusive), and so should be avoided by the user.
.jcgSUBSECTION VS Fortran Version 2
The DIMFILM library for use with VS Fortran is available on the GRAPHICS mini-disk.  Access to this must be achieved by inclusion of an appropriate command:
GIME GRAPHICS
To access the DIMFILM library it is further necessary to incorporate a couple of GLOBAL commands.  These, for regular users of DIMFILM, might best be included in their PROFILE EXEC file:
.jcgdisplay

      GLOBAL TXTLIB DIMFILM VSF2FORT CMSLIB

      GLOBAL LOADLIB VSF2LOAD


.jcgendd
A typical Fortran program would appear as:
.jcgdisplay
            PROGRAM TEST
            ...
            CALL D35
            .. <Program including calls to DIMFILM routines>
            CALL DIMEND
            STOP
            END

.jcgendd
This should be compiled, loaded and executed in the normal manner.  The GLOBAL commands will ensure the correct satisfaction of references to DIMFILM routines at the appropriate point.
.jcgcontig INLINE
The DIMFILM library is large, the memory required will depend on the modules referenced by the user.
When multiple libraries are used with DIMFILM it is possible that the default Loader table sizes may be exceeded - to avoid this, the default table size may be increased by including a command similar to the following:
SET LDRTBLS 14
H 59  696  696  0     0     0     0   1 1     0     0     0     0     0     0     1H.jcgspace 2
Note: Users who are new to the Amdahl will find general documentation on running jobs in the Amdahl Handbook, published by ULCC.  In particular see Chapter 2.2 for details of running jobs and Chapters 3.0 and 3.2.1 for details of using the FORTRAN compiler.

.jcgSECTION Amdahl 5890 - MVS Service
The DIMFILM library is produced under Fortran 77 and made available for use with both VS Fortran and Siemens Fortran 77.  Separate libraries are maintained for use with these compilers.  DIMFILM is built with the latest version of each compiler, and so all jobs should follow the JOB statement with
/*JOBPARM P=PROC02
.jcgSUBSECTION VS Fortran
The DIMFILM library for use with VS Fortran is available on SYS2.DFILMVS.LIB, and should be used in conjunction with release 5.0 of VS Fortran, which is obtained by immediately following the JOB statement with
/*JOBPARM P=PROC02
To access the DIMFILM library LLIB1='SYS2.DFILMVS.LIB' may be used in the FVS procedure.  A simple job to produce output on 35mm black and white film might be :
.jcgdisplay
  JCL

      //<jobname>   JOB  '<name and delivery>',REGION=2000K
      //*PASSWORD <MVS password>
      /*JOBPARM P=PROC02
      //         EXEC    FVSCLG,LLIB1='SYS2.DFILMVS.LIB'
      //C.SYSIN  DD  *
            PROGRAM TEST
            ...
            CALL D35
            .. <Program including calls to DIMFILM routines>
            CALL DIMEND
            STOP

            .. <Program including calls to DIMFILM routines>
            CALL DIMEND

The DIMFILM library is large and it will almost certainly be necessary to request more than the default memory allocation using the REGION parameter on the JOB statement.  The default is 600K and the maximum is over 7000K, although no more than 6500K should normally be requested.  (Numbers are decimal and specify units of 1K (1000) bytes).
When multiple libraries are used with DIMFILM it is possible that the default Linkage Editor/Loader table sizes may be exceeded giving an MVS IEW0484 TABLE OVERFLOW error.  To avoid this, the default table sizes may be increased by including the following parameters in the appropriate JCL EXEC statement:
.jcgdisplay
    Using the Linkage Editor:
          LPARM='SIZE=(2000K,64K)',LREGN=2000K
    or using the Loader:
          LPARM='SIZE=2000K',LREGN=2000K

.jcgSUBSECTION Siemens Fortran
The DIMFILM library for use with Siemens Fortran is available on SYS2.DFILM77.LIB.  This may be accessed by utilising the LLIB1 parameter in the F77 procedure.  It is recommended that Version 4 of Siemens Fortran be used - considerable savings in CP time and memory can be achieved.  A simple job to produce output on 35mm black and white film might be:
.jcgdisplay
      //<jobname>   JOB  '<name and delivery>',REGION=2000K
      //*PASSWORD <MVS password>
      /*JOBPARM P=PROC02

.jcgSECTION Cray X-MP - UNICOS Service
The DIMFILM routines are available as a library, compiled with the CFT77 compiler and accessible on /lib as libdimfilm.a.  The normal usage will involve only the declaration of dimfilm as a library; either to segldr or cf77, via the -l option.  There is no need to use any other graphics library in order to produce output on film.  A simple job to produce output on 35mm black and white film might be:
.jcgdisplay
      cat test.f <</EOF
            PROGRAM TEST
            ...
            CALL D35

            CALL DIMEND
            STOP
            END
      /EOF
      cf77 -l dimfilm test.f


alternatively, the last command may be replaced by:

      cft77 test.f
      segldr -l dimfilm test.o
