Historic DIMFILM Materials
==========================

The files here contain the DIMFILM source written by John Gilbert
as originally received, as well as the original DIMFILM manual
source.

Almost all the files have modification dates in 1991, with a small
number in 1992 and 1993. To preserve this date information, the
contents of the DIMFILM tree are also stored in dimfilm-archive.tgz
which is a compressed tar archive file.

I believe that most of the code was actually written around 1983
to 1984, although dates in the code are rare (there are some, mostly
in the MVS subdirectory code). Device driver changes for UNICOS are
dated 1988 and for Convex 1990. The latest date in the code seems
to be 1991.

Note that the source files need to be pre-processed to create
compilable code, and other changes may be needed. No pre-processor
is included here. Conversion to the current DIMFILM code started
with the code in DIMFILM/DECKS. This work was mostly done in 2007/8
with further changes mostly in 2024/25 to further tidy things up.

The original .DK source files are now thought to be only of historic
interest.

The Microsoft Word and Wordstar versions of the DIMFILM manual
could be of great interest if anyone can find software that can
"open" them. The Word files could not be opened with Microsoft Word 
as it was in 2007 and almost certainly will not work with today's
Word. The format pre-dates .doc (it is .msw). 

Thanks are due to Dr. Adrian Clark who used and ported DIMFILM to
VAX/VMS and various Unix systems in the 1980's and early 1990's. It
is through him that the source code here was obtained directly from
John Gilbert (in 2005).
