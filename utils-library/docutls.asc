*NOSEQ
PLUTILS - Utility Library and Programs
======================================

This program library contains the source of an object library (LBUTILS)
that provides some string handling and NOS interface functions and a
number of programs that use these functions.

Simple utility programs
-----------------------

+ Date
    DATE
  This simply prints the current date and time, according to NOS.
  For example:
    22/06/07.  18.02.11.
+ Uptime
    UPTIME
  This displays how long since system deadstart in hours, minutes and
  seconds. For example:
    UPTIME =  22 DAYS 23 HOURS 16 MINS  3.173 SECS
+ Whoami
    WHOAMI
  This displays the name, user id hash and the current JSN. For example:
    NICK 000036 AAHQ    AAKV


URNet utility programs
----------------------

These programs are only useful when running the DtCyber version that
supports "Unit Record Network", along with the many helper programs and
scripts that go along with that. See the URNet document for more
information.

+ Decode file
    DECFL,I=infile,O=outfile.
  This decodes the hexadecimal encoded text file $infile$ to a text or
  binary file, $outfile$. It is normally run as part of a batch job
  used for file transfers to the local machine by URNet.
+ Encode file
    ENCFL,I=infile,O=outfile,T=type,R=route.
  This encodes a text or binary file, $infile$ to a hexadecimal encoded
  text file, $outfile$. The $type$ argument may be $NORMAL$, $ASCII$,
  $BINARY$ or $GUESS$, and is the type of data in the file. The $route$
  argument is a string decoded by URNet helper programs running on the
  DtCyber host machine and allows the file to be routed to another
  modern host machine on the LAN or to another NOS machine.


LBUTILS Library
===============

The library can be installed and built as follows:

+ Obtain the RECLAIM tape image containing PLUTILS (VSN=PLUTIL). This
  is the $.tap$ file $plutils.tap$. Put this in the $tapes$
  subdirectory of the active DtCyber tree.
+ Use the following commands:
    OP: lt 13,0,1,r,tapes/plutils.tap
    TT: RECLAIM,DB=0,Z./LOAD,TN=PLUTIL,PF=PLUTILS.
    TT: GET,PLUTILS.
    TT: MODEXEC,BUILD,PLUTILS.
    OP: ut 13,0,1
  Note: $OP$ denotes typing in the DtCyber operator console, and $TT$
  in the user's timesharing terminal.
  This is build the library and the utility programs and install the
  binaries into a library called $BINLIB$. This may be added to the
  global library set (similar to "the path" on mainstream systems)
  using:
    ATTACH,BINLIB.
    LIBRARY,BINLIB/A.
+ Building the documentation requires the $DOCFTN5$ and $PMDHTML$
  programs, which are to be found in $PLDOCPR$. Once they have been
  built and installed, the following should build the documentation
  and install it on the local NOS website:
    TT: MODEXEC,BUILD,PLUTILS,ARG=DOC.

LBUTILS function categories
---------------------------

The functions in $LBUTILS$ can be divided into 4 categories:
+ $CHARS$ are functions to manipulate FORTRAN $CHARACTER$ data. Many
  of them were originally written for VAX/VMS, so they generally do not
  understand NOS 6/12 encoding for lower case and other ASCII character
  codes.
+ $STRING$ functions are an alternative method of processing ASCII
  character data in which 6/12 data is converted to integer ASCII codes
  (and held in $INTEGER$ variables). In this way, 1 character occupies
  1 storage location, which makes many things simpler. There is a fairly
  comprehensive set of these functions, which are all written for NOS.
+ $FILE I/O$ functions provide some limited access to NOS files at a
  lower level than FORTRAN I/O.
+ $NOS I/F$ functions provide easy access to some NOS system facilities.

The next section contains documentation generated from the source code
by $DOCFTN5$.
